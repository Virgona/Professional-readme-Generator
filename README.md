## Motovation

I wanted to create an app that I could use to quickly and accurately provide a user with a professional grade readme that they can use in a pinch for their projects

## Installation

Installation is easy! Copy the package from my repo and in the command line enter 'npm i' in order to download the dependances. Then enter 'index.js' to begin the app

## Challenges

I didnt face many challenges this time around. Maybe figuring out the best way to get badges displayed. Although I did find it tough to understand how fs works and what parameters it needs - though my tutor was able to explain it to me easily

## Successes

The greatest achiement came from writing the bulk of code from my head without going back over notes. Then when I ran the basic inquirer prompt it worked first time!
